#### install 

For the first time, Tensorboard was made for tensorflow. However thanks to [awesome library](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX), we can use it as tensorboardX in Pytorch.

You can simply install tensorboardX using pip or [github](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX) clone

```python
pip install tensorboardX
```

or

```python
pip install 'git+https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX'
```

As mentioned, tensorboard is tensorflow library. Therefore to run the tensorboard in web, we need `tensorflow`.

**it is different with torchvision.**
